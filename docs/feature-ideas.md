## Game Mechanics

### Trains and rail tracks

A 'rails' terrain type and a 'train' transport unit, with a very high
movement stat, but which only can move on 'rails' terrain (e.g. by
having a very large movement cost on all other terrain types).

#### Depends on

* Transport units.
* Different movement costs for different unit types.
